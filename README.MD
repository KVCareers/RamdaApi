## Business Logic
Business Logic is broken out into "services" and "logic". 
Service files are meant to perform tasks.
Logic files are meant to call services and perform business logic on the data.

Any Business Logic service files should be created at:

src/business_logic/services
```

Any Business Logic logic files should be created at:
```
src/business_logic/logic
```

## Models
Any Models should be created at:

# Project Naming Conventions
- Folders should always use snake case such as "business_logic" or "my_folder"
- Files should always use kebab case as well as "type indicators". 
  - Services should be named with ".service.ts" such as "hello-world.service.ts"
  - Models should be named with ".model" such as "person.model.ts"

# Generating Models for External APIs
To generate model files for external API's, this project uses [quicktype](https://quicktype.io/). 
You can use either the website itself, or the Visual Studio Code extension "Paste JSON as Code" by the author "quicktype"
